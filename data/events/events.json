    "description": "Trustworthiness assessment of information sources is a useful alternative to automated fact-checking for the detection of disinformation online. In cases like experts' debates, the use of trustworthiness metrics on sources is a useful proxy for establishing the truthfulness of contents. In this talk I shall present recent work [1,2] on an algorithmic model for automatically generating a dynamic trustworthiness hierarchy among information sources based on a logical framework for agent-based trust evaluation [3] and enhanced by several parameters, including fact-checking. The method is a helpful tool for laypeople to navigate experts’ debates, which can also be supported by graphical aids. Current work is devoted to a probabilistic extension to model debates where the ability to reach information depends on its frequency, determining uncertainty in the value of trust associated to its source and a level of confidence in the resulting hierarchy.<br /><br /> [1] Davide Ceolin, Francesca Doneda, Giuseppe Primiero: Computable Trustworthiness Ranking of Medical Experts in Italy during the SARS-CoV-19 Pandemic.

    "description": "AI systems have become ubiquitous and indispensable in the functioning of modern digital societies. Consequently, we inevitably act on the outputs of these algorithmic systems, thereby attributing to them a form of algorithmic authority. However, is this algorithmic authority legitimate? I assess this question on the basis of democratic accounts of legitimate authority. AI systems are embedded in how they are developed and deployed, which is predominantly done by private, for-profit companies outside of democratic control. In those cases, I argue that algorithmic authority is currently illegitimate. This becomes particularly problematic when we have no choice but to act on a system's output, such as with Automated Decision Systems. As a result, the development and deployment of AI systems should be grounded in democratically legitimate design procedures.",

Over almost seventy years  it’s been attached to a range of loosely related projects, none of which  have yet come close to delivering on the promise of creating computer  systems with human-like intelligence. One insider characterized the story of AI as “the history of failed ideas.” Yet in  the process of failing, early AI researchers made vital but incidental  contributions to the development of computer technology and computer  science. In this talk I’ll ask where did discussion of artificial intelligence come from, why was it so attractive to  researchers and sponsors, and what did the lofty rhetoric of machine  intelligence have to do with the actual practice of artificial  intelligence as it institutionalized through research labs, curricula, textbooks, and professional associations? I’ll also  look for continuities and discontinuities between our own moment and  earlier cycles of AI hype and disillusionment.",

The treatment extracts properties of abstraction, control, structure, finiteness, effective mechanism, and imperativity, and intentional aspects of goal and preconditions. The focus on the algorithm as a robust conceptual object obviates issues of correctness and minimality. Neither the articulation of an algorithm nor the dynamic process constitute the algorithm itself. Analysis for implications in computer science and philosophy reveals unexpected results, new questions, and new perspectives on current questions, including the relationship between our informally construed algorithms and Turing machines. Exploration in terms of current computational and philosophical thinking invites further developments.",

    "description": "Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems are often complex and opaque. At the same time, they are becoming increasingly prevalent in our lives. As a result, there is an increasing demand to make AI systems explainableand their behaviour intelligible. Recent work primarily approaches this problem by employing specific explainability methods to aid in-context understanding. We think, however, that important desiderata such as safety and reliability might be best satisfied through the increase of expert understanding with respect to how AI systems work. We suggest this requires research from the scientific perspective. This approach starts from the premise that once AI systems become sufficiently complex, they are best investigated and explained through the same lens as biological organisms. Accordingly, this work seeks to characterise the functional structure that emerges in AI systems through training. As we will describe, researchers pursuing this approach adopt strategies for discovery that have proved successful in the life sciences, such as pattern recognition, functional decomposition, localization, and systematic manipulation. In this talk, we discuss the promises and limitations of the scientific approach to understanding AI systems. We contend that uncovering their emergent structure plays an important and underappreciated role in solving the explainability problem in AI.",

    "description": "The feeling of clarity can be dangerously seductive. It is the feeling associated with understanding things. And we use that feeling, in the rough-and-tumble of daily life, as a signal that we have investigated a matter sufficiently. The sense of clarity functions as a thought-terminating heuristic. In that case, our use of clarity creates significant cognitive vulnerability, which hostile forces can try to exploit. If an epistemic manipulator can imbue a belief system with an exaggerated sense of clarity, then they can induce us to terminate our inquiries too early – before we spot the flaws in the system. How might the sense of clarity be faked? Let’s first consider the object of imitation: genuine understanding. Genuine understanding grants cognitive facility. When we understand something, we categorize its aspects more easily; we see more connections between its disparate elements; we can generate new explanations; and we can communicate our understanding. In order to encourage us to accept a system of thought, then, an epistemic manipulator will want the system to provide its users with an exaggerated sensation of cognitive facility. The system should provide its users with the feeling that they can easily and powerfully create categorizations, generate explanations, and communicate their understanding. And manipulators have a significant advantage in imbuing their systems with a pleasurable sense of clarity, since they are freed from the burdens of accuracy and reliability.",

    "description": "The use of machine learning and other second-wave AI techniques  in scientific research has become very successful lately. One often cited example is AlphaFold, which determines the three-dimensional structure of proteins. Such undertakings have led many commentators to claim that we are in the midst of a scientific revolution. Some even go so far as to consider the possibility of fully automated science in the near future and argue that these developments will render traditional, theory based science a relic of the past. These claims raise several questions: What kinds of AI are employed in science? What is meant by 'revolution'? And which parts of science are considered? My talk will therefore be divided into three parts, each of which will address one of the questions: The first part will examine, what makes second-wave AI so successful compared to GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence) and where it falls short. Further the key differences between the different types of AI will be elaborated in order to understand better where and how AI can be utilized in science. The second part addresses the areas of the research process where AI is used, such as in developing new hypotheses and searching for patterns in Big Data, as well as the differences and similarities between disciplines that use AI. The goal is to comprehend the scope of AI in science: How much of the research process can be covered by AI? The final part will address the question of whether the use of AI science justifies the revolutionary rhetoric that accompanies it. For this, the notion of scientific revolution will be considered from Kuhnian and post-Kuhnian perspectives. These will then be applied to the considerations elaborated in parts one and two with respect to scope and potential applications in order to make a classification and assessment of the AI revolution in science.",

We consider what it means for a machine to deceive, and describe various forms of deceptive AI that have been implemented and studied. To gain perspective on their significance, we categorize the methods they use according to recognizably human deceits: imitating, obfuscating, tricking, calculating and framing. While these developments demonstrate that some aspects of deceptive behaviour can indeed be delegated to machines, AI systems still fall short of sophisticated human deception. To explore this gap we present an analysis of techniques used by stage magicians to deceive their audiences, and consider whether and how machines might come to be truly deceptive in similar ways.",

    "description": "Machine learning methods have recently created high expectations in the climate modelling context in view of addressing climate change, but they are often considered as non-physics-based ‘black boxes’ that may not provide any understanding. However, in many ways, understanding seems indispensable to appropriately evaluate climate models and to build confidence in climate projections. Relying on two case studies, we compare how machine learning and standard statistical techniques affect our ability to understand the climate system. For that purpose, we put five evaluative criteria of understanding to work: intelligibility, representational accuracy, empirical accuracy, coherence with background knowledge, and assessment of the domain of validity.We argue that the two families of methods are part of the same continuum where these various criteria of understanding come in degrees, and that therefore machine learning methods do not necessarily constitute a radical departure from standard statistical tools, as far as understanding is concerned.",

Yet, given that the socio-epistemic dynamics that underlie fake news are here to stay, it is equally important to think about how we can navigate treacherous informational environments. I argue that this requires the cultivation of epistemic routines that reduce our exposure to misleading and deceptive information, while at the same time continuing to allow us to partake in the collective growth of knowledge. Shifting the focus to epistemic routines steers a middle path between two purported solutions that have received much attention: viz., between emphasizing the individual’s responsibility to ‘think critically and check one’s sources’ and advocating technological tweaks (such as automated fact-checking). While epistemic agents ought to be held responsible for the epistemic routines they commit themselves to, there is also a collective need for making the predictable effects of such choices transparent to individuals, wherever this is technologically possible.",

These current changes involve shifts in the methodology and epistemology of knowledge production, especially in the ways in which scientific knowledge and non-scientific knowledge are entangled and/or distinguished. The interdisciplinary network approaches the emerging 'algorithmic regimes' by focusing on media practices like coding, algorithm-design and -use to ask how these practices reshape, extend but also complicate the understanding of scientific and non-scientific knowledge production in an era of algorithmic big data-analysis.",

    "description": "While the ethical problems of AI and social robotics have been foregrounded during the past decade, this talk addresses the conceptual problems that arise when artificial agents present themselves as social agents. With focus on social robotics in particular, I argue that in the current research situation we first need (philosophical) ontology and then ethics--more precise descriptions of human social interactions with robots will enable us to produce the sort of empirical data that can ground detailed ethical recommendations. I introduce the descriptive framework OASIS (Ontology of Asymmetric Social Interactions) which is based on three constructional ideas: degrees of simulation, levels of sociality, and perspectivalness.  As I try to show, OASIS offere simple, yet sufficiently expressive and precise descriptive tools that can facilitate the interdisciplinary integration of Human-Robot Interaction Research.",

    "description": "In this talk, I will describe a machine implementation of assimilative apperception that is based on Kant’s discussion of the \"synthetic unity of apperception\" in the Critique of Pure Reason. Imagine a machine, equipped with various sensors. Perhaps it has some light sensors, perhaps a microphone, perhaps some touch sensors. The machine receives a stream of sensory input, and must \"make sense\" of this stream. – But what does it mean, exactly, for a robot to “make sense” of the sensory stream? In machine learning, this is called the \"unsupervised learning problem\", and it is still relatively under-explored and misunderstood. I will argue that the answer to this contemporary question lies, hiding in plain sight, in the first half of the First Critique. Our computer agent assimilates information by constructing a theory that explains the sensory stream and that satisfies four unity conditions. First, the objects must be unified in space. Second, the predicates must be unified in the \"space of reasons\" by featuring in mutual incompatibility relations. Third, the various propositions must be unified into a \"moment\" (a consistent and complete cluster of propositions that together represent a single slice of time). The fourth and final unity condition is that moments must be unified into a sequence by causal rules. Apperceiving a sensory sequence means constructing a theory that explains the sequence and satisfies the four unity conditions. This is a form of program synthesis, but it is unsupervised program synthesis. In this talk, I will not focus on the gory technical details of the unsupervised program synthesis system, but on the general architecture, the underlying Kantian principles that inspired the architecture, and on a diverse range of experiments which show the versatility of the approach.",

In the first part of this talk, I will introduce several different XAI methods and evaluate the extent to which they can actually be used to solve the Black Box Problem. In the second part of this talk, I will consider whether these same methods can also be used to solve a variety of more traditional philosophical problems: from philosophy of science, the problem of inferring causal relationships; from ethics, the problem of attributing moral responsibility for the behavior of autonomous systems; and from philosophy of mind, the problem of identifying genuine kinds of machine intelligence.",

    "description": "Kolloquium in Cooperation with the Research Group \"Modelling Trust\" of the HLRS Stuttgart. Abstract:<br/> There is concern that the methods of machine learning (ML) offer limited support for scientific inference. The worry is that while ML methods are apt for spotting hidden patterns in large, complex datasets, the output of such methods is neither readily interpretable nor accompanied by clear error bounds or degrees of confidence. More broadly, science generally aims at causal knowledge, and the statistical methods of ML are not reliable guides to causal relations. However, if ML is understood broadly to encompass all algorithms that learn from empirical experience, these fears are misguided. In this talk, I outline the remarkable progress over the last three decades in finding algorithmic solutions to a series of scientific inference problems: (1) combining causal knowledge with statistical learning techniques, (2) discovering causal structure, (3) identifying laws of nature, and (4) inventing novel scientifically salient variables. I argue that these advances represent a powerful armamentarium for automated scientific discovery. But this armamentarium is incomplete. I close by indicating an overlooked step in experimental inquiry that remains poorly characterized and consequently cannot yet be automated.",
