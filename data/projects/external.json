    "description": "Most of temporary scientific research depends essentially on the employment of complex software, although scientists are usually not trained in programming and software engineering. From the perspective of Philosophy of Science (PoS) the increase in scientific software as research tools is of epistemic and analytic interest; and for Software Engineering (SE) the analysis and improvement of the architecture and algorithmic structure of software projects is important. Thus, both disciplines focus on the analysis of code and share the conjoint interest in the development of new domain-specific methods for the analysis of scientific (open) software projects.",

    "description": "Can we simulate post-monetary, or even non-monetary economies? Research on the commons has particularly inspired our approach to a society after money. Elinor Ostrom’s Nobel Prize for Economics in 2009 made clear that commons economies are possible, albeit locally restricted. Using agent-based modelling, we are experimenting with scaling up such local commons economies. This international research group of media scientists, economists and philosophers explores the collision of digital technology with the entity money.",

Without generalization comparability of models can't be achieved, in turn, reproducibility of results isn't possible, and it is difficult to give guidance to the design of neuromorphic systems. Furthermore, without generalization of models scaling-up complexity isn't possible (complexity barrier), thus, hindering progress in knowledge. Therefore, we want to conceptionally explore generalization and evaluate new ideas on generalization about their practical feasibility.",

While most of the smart cars, robots, and algorithms discussed by the broader public have yet to be developed in academic and industrial labs, the massive exposure of users to AI in computer games is part of everyday experience for millions. Thus, our main hypothesis is that AI is not a future technology, but has long since invaded the living rooms of our society today, opening up an unexplored 'sociointelligent space'. Mind the Game! explores this socio-intelligent space of AI in games that interact with users theoretically, empirically, and technologically.",

    "description": "Science has been using computer simulations since the 1950s. Expanding computer capacity, the development of simulation tools and algorithms, and increasingly complex visualisation technologies have established computer simulations as powerful instruments of scientific knowledge production beside theory and experimentation. Simulations can be regarded as activities in a virtual laboratory setting – comparable to experimenting in a laboratory setting. This method of knowledge production is determined by various conditions: the digital and algorithmic processing of data, modelling, and using computer power to run the models. These conditions restrict simulation-based knowledge production and yield a methodologically inherent potential of uncertainty. Efforts to keep the uncertainties within an acceptable limit of error tolerance are forcing the focal question about the methods and practises used to construct simulation models and to validate their results.",
