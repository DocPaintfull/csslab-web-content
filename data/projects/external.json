Without generalization comparability of models can't be achieved, in turn, reproducibility of results isn't possible, and it is difficult to give guidance to the design of neuromorphic systems. Furthermore, without generalization of models scaling-up complexity isn't possible (complexity barrier), thus, hindering progress in knowledge. Therefore, we want to conceptionally explore generalization and evaluate new ideas on generalization about their practical feasibility.",

    "description": "Science has been using computer simulations since the 1950s. Expanding computer capacity, the development of simulation tools and algorithms, and increasingly complex visualisation technologies have established computer simulations as powerful instruments of scientific knowledge production beside theory and experimentation. Simulations can be regarded as activities in a virtual laboratory setting – comparable to experimenting in a laboratory setting. This method of knowledge production is determined by various conditions: the digital and algorithmic processing of data, modelling, and using computer power to run the models. These conditions restrict simulation-based knowledge production and yield a methodologically inherent potential of uncertainty. Efforts to keep the uncertainties within an acceptable limit of error tolerance are forcing the focal question about the methods and practises used to construct simulation models and to validate their results.",
